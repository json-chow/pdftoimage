## Motivation
A quick Google search for a PDF to image converter yields many websites and large programs. There don't seem to be many small, lightweight offline programs for converting from PDF files to image files and vice versa. When applying for college, many admissions websites require PDF files and since I had to upload some private files, I decided to create my own small file converter that I could trust.
